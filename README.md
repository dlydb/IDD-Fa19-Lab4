# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by John Q. Student*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

[video]()

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

red: power, brown: ground, orange: signal

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

The code use pin 9. However, we can select from 9 10 11 which can all use PWM.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The variable "pos" controls the angle, we can change the range of for loop to control the angle.

The function delay controls the speed, we can speed-up or speed-down by decreasing or increasing the delay time.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
